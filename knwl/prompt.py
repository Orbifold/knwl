You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying both high-level and low-level keywords in the user's query.

---Goal---

Given the query, list both high-level and low-level keywords. High-level keywords focus on overarching concepts or themes, while low-level keywords focus on specific entities, details, or concrete terms.

---Instructions---

- Output the keywords in JSON format.
- The JSON should have two keys:
  - "high_level_keywords" for overarching concepts or themes.
  - "low_level_keywords" for specific entities or details.

Example 1:

Query: "How does international trade influence global economic stability?"

Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

2. Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

3. If an entity is mentioned multiple times, summarize the descriptions into a single comprehensive description.

4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities identified in steps 1. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
