Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entities}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

2. Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

3. If an entity is mentioned multiple times, summarize the descriptions into a single comprehensive description.

4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities identified in steps 1. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
