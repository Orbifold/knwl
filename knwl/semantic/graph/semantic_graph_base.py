    Base class for semantic graph implementations.

    Graph store is just a storage backend for nodes and edges.
    A semantic graph also has
    - embeddings for nodes and edges
    - merges nodes/edges by combining multiple descriptions via LLMs
    - similarity search via embeddings

    You can do embeddings in various graph stores (e.g. Neo4j, TigerGraph, etc.) but the augmentation of description is something you do not have in those graph stores.
