class GleanGraphExtraction(BasicGraphExtraction):
    """
    An advanced extraction class that iteratively refines entity extraction through multiple gleaning passes.

    This class extends BasicExtraction to perform iterative entity extraction, where after the initial
    extraction, it performs additional "gleaning" passes to find entities that may have been missed
    in the first attempt. The process continues until no new entities are found or the maximum
    number of gleaning iterations is reached.

    Attributes:
        max_glean (int): Maximum number of gleaning iterations to perform. Defaults to 3.
                        If set to 1 or less, falls back to basic extraction behavior.

    Methods:
        to_messages(question, answer): Converts a question-answer pair into message format for LLM context.
        extract_records(text, entities): Performs iterative entity extraction with gleaning passes.

    The gleaning process:
    1. Performs initial entity extraction using the parent class approach
    2. For each gleaning iteration:
       - Asks the LLM to find additional entities based on previous context
       - Checks if new entities were found
       - Asks if the process should continue
       - Stops early if no new entities found or continuation not needed
    3. Combines all extracted entities from all iterations
    4. Parses and returns the final collection of entity records
