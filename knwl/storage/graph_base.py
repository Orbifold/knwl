class GraphStorageBase(FrameworkBase):
    """
    Base class for graph storage implementations.
    Strictly speaking, the graph is a directed multigraph, meaning multiple edges can exist between the same pair of nodes.
    This abastract base class does not use the KnwlNode or KnwlEdge models directly, but the data is expected to be in the form of dictionaries
    that can be converted to/from those models. That is, you can use a GraphBase independently of the higher level mechanisms in knwl.

    - The 'id' (string) should be unique for nodes and edges and present in the data (payload dictionary). If not provided, a uuid4 will be generated.
    - The 'name' (optional string) is not unique and can be the same for different nodes (e.g. "Apple" as fruit and as company).
    - The 'type' (string) is a semantic type (e.g. Person, Company, Location, Product, Event, etc.) and is optional. If not provided, it will be set to "Unknown".
