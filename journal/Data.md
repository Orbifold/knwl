# Data

The term "data" within Knwl refers either to [[Storage]] or to [[Models]]. Storage is the low-level mechanism for storing raw information, while Models are higher-level abstractions that define how data is structured and interacted with. A model in usually synonymous with 'Pydantic Model' but the storage also handles dictionaries, lists of strings and more.
