The easiest way to store a file is, well, to just store it as a file on disk. However, for more robust and scalable storage, especially in distributed systems, using an object storage service like Amazon S3 is often preferred. The `S3Storage` class provides an interface to interact with S3-compatible storage services.

If you don't have access to Amazon S3, you can use SeaweedFS, an open-source distributed file system that provides an S3-compatible API. This allows you to test and develop applications that use S3 storage without incurring costs associated with Amazon S3. You can run SeaweedFS locally using Docker with the following command:

```bash
 docker run -d --name seaweed -p 8333:8333 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=does-not-matter -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=does-not-matter chrislusf/seaweedfs server -s3
```

This particular combination of environment variables is used in the unit tests for the `S3Storage` class, but you can customize them as needed.
